                            The purpose of this lab is to enable connection from the Remote Operations Console you customized and deployed in Lab 1, to an on-prem private cloud service provided by a fictional company, "IEL Drones-To-Go". You will use an <b>IBM Satellite Link</b> to allow the Remote Operations Console running on the IBM Public Cloud to access the drone controller service, which is located on a private satellite cluster (OpenShift Container Platform) cluster at the satellite location: the IEL (Industry Engineering Lab) in Coppell, TX.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This lab also uses <b>App Connect</b> to integrate a drone controller service without worrying about its data formats in order to transform data. It does this through intelligent mapping functions and converts the drone’s proprietary data to be destination-specific in transit, making it ready for alignment in the destination Remote Operations Console application.

                <p>
                    When you made a request to take this hands-on lab, there were some background tasks that were performed on your behalf to prepare the lab environment, which are described below. Don't worry if you have some questions about these concepts... you will get a lot more explanation and hands-on experience as you move through lab steps.
                </p>

                    <span class="blue">Created Two Lab Environment Flows </span><br/>

                    As depicted above, a <b>production flow</b> describes how sensor data flows from IEL Drones-To-Go (left hand side for both diagrams) to the visual command center where a Situational Awareness Operator (right hand side for both diagrams) gain situational awareness and asses the situation. The production flow was created to support new functionality that illustrates Hybrid Cloud integration between the Remote Drone Console application at the IBM Public Cloud and drone controller application at the satellite location running on the IEL private cloud. <br/><br/>
                    
                    An <b>additional lab flow</b> was created to facilitate the hands-on activities with IBM’s most common integration services in a Hybrid Multicloud context, which each user will encounter in steps 1-3.<br/><br/>
                    
                    The lab users will have the option to execute the <b>production</b> flow in <b>Step 4</b>.

                <p>
                    <span class="blue">Created Drone Controller services in IEL Private Cloud </span><br/>
                    
                    The <b>drone controller application</b> is an integral part of this lab – it interacts with physical and virtual resources at the IEL and its private cloud, along with providing API endpoints that can orchestrate the appropriate functionality. This application, along with a drone activity database, was deployed within a Satellite OpenShift cluster on an on-prem satellite location at IEL private cloud, which is used for the lab’s production flow. 
                </p>

                    <span class="blue">Provisioned a classic OpenShift cluster in the IBM Cloud environment </span><br/>

                    A classic IBM Cloud organization OCP cluster is where the Remote Drone Console application will be deployed and acts as the public cloud.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="blue">Provisioned a satellite OpenShift cluster @ Satellite location in the IBM Cloud environment </span><br/>

                    A satellite OCP cluster that will be in focus in steps 1-2 of this lab acts as a simulated private cloud. This additional satellite cluster was created in the IBM Cloud environment to enable each lab user to have visibility into the Satellite location’s hosts, services, link endpoints, application artifacts and configurations that were deployed so that they can perform hands-on activities. In this cluster is where the lab flow’s drone controller application is installed and used for lab activities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="blue">Provisioned Cloud services </span><br/>

                    Several IBM Cloud services were prepared and provisioned for lab users within the IBM Cloud organization, including App Connect and IBM Cloudant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="blue">Deployed a project and artifacts for each lab user in the IBM Cloud </span><br/>

                    A project with simplified Remote Drone Console applications (one for production and other for the lab) was deployed for each lab user within the classic OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud. In addition, YAML files were provided to allow each user to walk through the setup of App Connect services.

                            The purpose of this setup was to demonstrate the Satellite technology in order to:<br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Build, deliver, and manage your applications across a hybrid multi-cloud environment.</li>
                                <li>Bring the best of cloud wherever it is needed to run, while maintaining the simple "as a service" experience.</li>
                                <li>Use a common control plane to manage your apps, platform, and security across our multi-cloud platform.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s take a moment to review some concepts that you will be delving into in the next few steps. Consider two parties involved:<br/>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Public Safety Situational Awareness Operators that use the Remote Drone Operations Console application, and,</li>
                                <li>An organization, "IEL Drones-To-Go", which has private on-prem resource in Coppell, TX that allows piloting and observing of local drones.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            IEL Drones-To-Go wants users like Public Safety Situational Awareness Operators to access their drone service, easily manage their access, make sure this connection is done securely so they are not compromised in any way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Public Safety Situational Awareness Operators, owners, and users of the Remote Drone Operations Console want to connect the service that IEL Drones-To-Go provides.
                        </p>

                        <img src="./img/1_overview_B.png" class="standardImage" />

                        <p>
                            You will explore how IBM Satellite Link endpoints can help <b>enable the connection</b> between the Public Safety Situational Awareness Operators in one cloud environment, and the IEL Drones-To-Go services that are running in another cloud environment. 
                        </p>

                                            Satellite extends IBM Cloud with the new concept of a "location." <span class="blue">Locations</span> refer to any infrastructure where you can run services and applications. Once a location is created, you can start using that location to run IBM Cloud services, such as Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Databases, Continuous Delivery pipelines, AI and more.

                                            With <span class="blue">Satellite Link endpoints</span>, you can allow <b>any client</b> that runs in your Satellite location to connect to a service, server, or app that runs <b>outside of the location</b>, or allow a client running on an IBM Cloud private network to connect to a service, server, or app that runs <b>in your location</b>.
                                        </p>

                        <p>
                            IBM Cloud Satellite acts as a "Hybrid Cloud Mesh" that creates <b>distributed cloud regions</b> anywhere you have <b>infrastructure</b>. Through this hybrid mesh, you can manage each location from a common control plane. IBM Cloud Satellite does this by attaching <b>remote infrastructure</b> in a remote location to your Cloud Satellite <b>control plane</b>. This location can then be used by IBM Cloud services as <b>deployment targets</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In this next step of the lab, you will learn about how to use Satellite Link Endpoints to <b>bridge a connection</b> between the <span class="blue">Remote Drone Operations Console</span> and the <span class="blue">on-prem resource</span> at IEL Drones-To-Go. In later steps, you will continue to get more access to the IEL Drones-To-Go service, including accessing APIs and even invoking related flows.

                            Remember that a <span class="blue">location</span> is a representation of an environment in your infrastructure provider, such as an on-prem data center or public cloud, that you want to bring IBM Cloud services to so that you can run workloads in your own environment. You create the location by attaching <b>host machines</b> <span class="blue">from your infrastructure</span>. In the context of a Satellite location, you can think of host machines as your own VMs, Bare Metal, or privately managed Iaas from your infrastructure. These host machines provide the computing power for running IBM cloud services in the Satellite location - for example, acting as the worker nodes in a RedHat OpenShift cluster. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To set up a Satellite location, you must first (1) create the location, (2) attach hosts to it, and then (3) create the location control plane.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <span class="blue">location control plane</span> runs resources that are managed by Satellite to help manage the hosts, clusters, and other resources that you attach to the location.

                            A satellite environment requires <b>at least</b> three hosts (recommended six) for a minimal control plane and additional hosts are required for each provisioned service. For our lab satellite environment, we have provisioned a satellite OpenShift cluster service to deploy the drone controller application. And so we have assigned three hosts to the control plane and another three hosts as worker nodes for OpenShift satellite cluster service. As with any other managed cluster, you need to plan for scaling the cluster and design it for resiliency, so at any point of time you can "attach host" and enable the Cloud Satellite control plane to provision more worker nodes as needed.

                        <p>
                            Look at each host listed, along with its <b>name, status, availability, labels, cluster, worker pool, zone, and IP address</b>. You will notice that control1, control2, and control3 hosts belong to the Control plane cluster, and worker1, worker2, and worker3 hosts belong to the govlab-satellite-satcloudcluster. The numbers at the end of each host name correspond to the zones as well (zone-1, zone-2, and zone-3). 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="blue">Zone</span> is a deployment area for compute resources such as virtual machines or bare metals. A Satellite location must have at least three zones that are physically separate so that you can spread out hosts evenly across the zones to increase high availability (High availability is a core discipline in an IT infrastructure to keep your apps up and running, even after a partial or full site failure). For example, your cloud provider might have three different zones within the same region (Dallas, Washington, etc) , or you might use three racks with three separate networking and power supply systems in an on-prem environment.

Any application can access the satellite location resources from the IBM Cloud or access the IBM Cloud resources from the Satellite location without any restrictions.

In this step, you will learn how to enable a <b>drone controller application</b> running on a <b>satellite location</b> at a client’s cloud to <b>accept requests</b> from IBM Cloud. To make this lab simple and more to the point, we have created this client’s cloud on IBM Cloud itself.

                            The applications running on a satellite location can have access to other applications and data that are <b>private</b> to that location. To access the drone controller application from IBM Cloud, we need to create a <span class="blue">link endpoint</span>.

                            But to make sense of it, let’s take a look at this lab’s overall flow:

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In Step 1, you explored <b>govlab-satellite-location</b>. Look at the diagram above and find it. <span style="color:#70AD47"><i>(Green color)</i></span>. This is a classic cluster.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In this Step 2, you will create a <b>Link Endpoint</b> in the <b>govlab-satellite-location</b>. <i></i>(You saw an example of one in Step 1.6.2)</i>. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            You will also explore the <b>govlab-satellite-satcloudcluster</b> <i>(diagram above, right side)</i> which contains your project that was provisioned for you. Within your <b>provisioned project</b>, there is a <b>drone controller application</b> that provides the drone service from IEL-Drones-To-Go. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The link endpoint you create will be connected via the <b>route URL</b> from this drone controller application in your provisioned project in the <b>govlab-satellite-satcloudcluster</b>.
                        </p>
                        

                        <p>
                            Remember, to invoke the <b>drone controller service</b> from the drone console application, you need to create a <b>link endpoint</b> on <b>govlab-satellite-location</b>. Think of it as a wire connecting the private cloud service and the public cloud dashboard application.

The route URL here will be used to make the link endpoint you will create soon.

                        <p class="orange">
                            Notice that the route location URL starts with <u>https</u> – the exposed protocol is <u>HTTPS</u>, which has a default port of <u>443</u>. This will be referenced and used in a later step.

                            The link endpoint creation process starts with asking <b>where</b> the destination resources are running. The drone controller is running at a satellite location and is the destination. Remember that the drone console application runs on IBM Cloud and will invoke it.

                            In the Protocol step, you will be asked about the <b>source protocol</b> and <b>server name indication</b>. The drone controller application provisioned for your lab uses HTTPS as <b>transport protocol</b> and for simplicity, no authentication certificates are implemented. In a real-world scenario, to securely transmit information, the transactions are secured by certificates and for that case, you must upload the authentication certificates to exchange information between the requestor and the provider.

                            💡 What is an SNI (Server Name Indication)? <span class="readmore">[Click to Read More]</span>

                        <div class="answer">
                            An SNI (server name indication) is like mailing a package to an apartment building instead of to a house. When mailing a package to someone's house, the street address <b><i>alone</i></b> is enough to get the package to the right person. But when a package goes to an apartment building, it needs the apartment unit number in addition to the street address; otherwise, the package might not go to the right person or might not be delivered at all.<br/><br/>
                            Many web servers are more like apartment buildings than houses: They host several domain names, and so the IP address alone is not enough to indicate which domain a user is trying to reach. This can result in the server showing the wrong SSL certificate, which prevents or terminates an HTTPS connection – just like a package can't be delivered to an address if the correct person doesn't sign for it.

                            The last step of the link endpoint creation is optional connection settings. You can set an <b>inactivity timeout</b> for your communication. If there is no activity (for the set inactivity timeout value) between the requestor and the service provider, the communication established between the two resources will be <b>terminated</b> and the resources will be freed from memory.

                                            In previous steps, you explored Satellite and configured link endpoints. As we consider the "IEL Drones-To-Go", you will now consider how the operators need their Remote Drone Console Application to be able to (1) <b>monitor available and nearby sensors</b> and (2) <b>retrieve the associated sensor data</b>. In this step, you will learn how IBM App Connect allows an <span class="blue">API flow</span> to quickly and easily be set up in order to find the <b>current coordinates</b> of the drone and retrieve <b>nearby sensor data</b> (from  <span class="blue">IBM Cloudant</span>) in the necessary format, and automatically update the data in their drone dashboard.

                                            <span class="blue">IBM App Connect</span> connects disparate applications very quickly, regardless of whether they are on the cloud or a private network. And significantly, there is no coding required. Using the App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud makes it easy to connect apps, even applications like Salesforce, Marketo, and SAP, so that when an event occurs in one application, or a request is made to an API, the other connected apps are updated automatically.

                            Below are some common templates used on App Connect. These contain prebuilt flows which can be created for an API, so that when the request is submitted (such as through a mobile or web application), the flow performs all its actions, and then returns a response that either confirms that the actions were successful, or returns the data that was requested.

                            With every service that is added, your application becomes more powerful due to it being linked to useful resources. In this step, you will learn how to use the latitude/longitude values parsed from the drone's telemetry data in order to retrieve data from a database of sensors, thereby creating a very helpful list of sensors near the drone.

                            Before you access the App Connect service, let’s take a look at the database of sensors. In real-life situations, a Public Safety Situational Awareness Operator may want to quickly look at the nearby sensors to gauge the condition of the location they are viewing through the drone.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The sensors’ information is stored in a Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant® is a fully managed, distributed database and is provided as an offering on IBM Cloud. It has already been added to your IBM Cloud account. Once you click on the service, launch the dashboard to view the databases. You will take a look at the databased named sensordb.

                            One of the many features Cloudant provides is IBM Cloud Geospatial, or "IBM Cloudant Geo". Cloudant Geo combines the advanced geospatial queries of a Geographic Information System (GIS) with the flexibility and adaptability of IBM Cloudant's database-as-a-service (DBaaS) capabilities. These capabilities include GeoJSON, IBM Cloudant Geo index, and more.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With IBM Cloudant Geo, all of the following are possible:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (1) Enable web and mobile developers to enhance their applications by using geospatial operations that go beyond simple bounding boxes<br/>
                            (2) Integrate with existing GIS applications, so that they can scale to accommodate different data sizes, concurrent users, and multiple locations.<br/>
                            (3) Provide a NoSQL capability for GIS applications, so that large streams of data can be acquired from devices, sensors, and satellites. This data can then be stored, processed, and syndicated across other web applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s take advantage of this feature. Sensors have locations that be filtered on – within Cloudant, you’re able to draw polygons on a map and define spatially which sensors to display in a given bounded area. Go ahead and draw a circle on the map to filter sensors.
                        </p>


                        <div class="step">Use the <b>Circle (dot icon) Tool</b> on the right menu bar to draw a circle around a map area of your choosing.</div>

                        <p>
                            The circle you drew has filtered the sensors to only return the ones that are located within the boundary. When you click the JSON view, the list of JSON data pertains to the sensor markers shown on the Map view.  While the details returned  at this point is limited to the identifier and coordinates for each individual sensor, this information could then be used to query the type and values for each sensor which is useful in later lab sub-steps.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the next sub-steps, you will use the location data you were able to return in the end of Step 2 in combination with the information located in the sensors in this database to return a list of sensors nearby.

                            Remember these two functions – <b>retrieveSensordata</b> and <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span>. You will focus on <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> for the purposes of activities in the next several steps, but you will also be exposed to <b>retrieveSensordata</b> and asked to consider it within the context of the lab’s Production Flow used by the Remote Drone Console application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Take a look at the various Properties associated with the <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> – droneid, lat, lon, radius, and response. You will provide a droneid, the latitude and longitude coordinates from the drone, and the radius you are interested in, and get a response. Notice that these properties are strings as well.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You may have noticed that <b>retrieveSensordata</b> has fewer Properties – only droneid and response. This will be explained as you continue through this lab section.

                        <p>
                            The <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> API is a simple API flow to demonstrate the capability and simplicity of the App Connect cloud service. For the lab, we developed this flow to show how a web application could get access to Cloudant sensor data that is in close proximity to a given drone’s location by providing the lat/long as input.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>retrieveSensordata</b> may be more typical of a production API flow in that it combines several steps and includes some additional logic. Specifically, this flow is different from the simplified <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> API flow as it retrieves the drone’s status and telemetry data using the drone controller’s GET/status API (from API Connect), parses the response to find the drone's location (latitude/longitude) information, and then uses those locations details as input to retrieve sensor readings from the Cloudant database that are in the relevant area. This flow is used by the Remote Drone Console application as part of the lab’s Production Flow.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            App Connect provides a model-driven, code-free approach that lets you easily implement your API operations as integration flows. For less experienced users, App Connect guides you through making models and integration flows you can use to build robust APIs. For experienced developers, App Connect's powerful tooling lets you extend the flow through code. In either model, the tool then builds well-formed OpenAPI definitions automatically. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can preview the flow within App Connect for <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> by clicking on the Operations tab on the section and then Edit flow (this may appear as "View Flow"). The flow you see is linear – Request > HTTP Invoke method > JSON Parse > Response. As you continue to finish this lab, consider how this flow could be used within the Remote Console Operations application.
                        </p>

                            <p>As mentioned above, the retrieveSensordata API flow is used in the lab’s Production Flow to expose an endpoint for the Remote Drone Console application to dynamically find the location on the drone and then access relevant sensor data that is nearby.</p>

                            <p>
                                The flow uses the following connectors and tools:<br/>
                                HTTP endpoint: To invoke the GET /status REST API call of API Connect (configured to the drone controller in IEL Private Cloud)<br/>
                                HTTP endpoint: To invoke the Cloudant’s geospatial REST API call<br/>
                                JSON Parsers: To parse the resultant HTTP response and map it to a defined object
                            </p>

                            <p>OPTIONAL: If you want to see the full flow, you can use "Edit flow" after clicking Operations within the retrieveSensordata section. (The button may also appear as "View Flow"). </p>

For this lab, you will turn off "Require application via API key". This lab does not include viewing the usage of the APIs so this authentication isn’t required. It should be noted that for production level implementations, it may be appropriate to require authentication so that applications that use this API would need to authenticate using an API key and secret or API key alone.   This section would thus manage its key sharing and provide visibility into the API usage after the API is online. Make sure you scroll down and save this change once it is turned off.

You were able to test the simplified <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> flow that you added within App Connect. If you look closely at the JSON results contained in the response, you may notice the type of sensor and current values for this particular device.

                        <p>
                            Thinking about our Remote Operations Console application, you can consider how App Connect’s flow can expose a single API (via the  /retrieveSensordata Production flow) that retrieves and parses a drone's current location, and then goes on to query the sensors in that immediate geospatial area to bring the values to the user. In the next step, you will visit and review the Remote Operations Console application's updated user interface and consider how these service connections enabled the Multi-Hybrid Cloud application with powerful functionality.

                        </h1>

                        <p>
                            In Steps 1, 2, and 3, you learned about IBM Satellite Technology, Satellite Link endpoints, and the App Connect service flows that were integrated with your Remote Operations Console application. Let’s review each briefly:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="blue">IBM Satellite</span> creates distributed cloud regions anywhere you have infrastructure. Through this hybrid mesh you can manage each location from a common control plane. Cloud Satellite does this by attaching remote infrastructure in a remote location to your Cloud Satellite control plane. This location can then be used by IBM Cloud services as deployment targets.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="blue">IBM Satellite Endpoint Link</span> provides secure connection between Locations and IBM Cloud. The link provides the following:<br/>
                            - <b><i>Control</i></b> – Allows control of traffic flow across the Link including SRE traffic.<br/>
                            - <b><i>Transparency</i></b> – Provides traffic-level transparency across the Link and access reporting.<br/>
                            - <b><i>Audit</i></b> – Provides service registration and policy-management of traffic-flow.<br/>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="blue">App Connect</span> is an all-in-one tool for easily connecting apps, integrating data, building APIs, and acting on events. Used to invoke flows that can retrieve nearby sensors based on location data of a drone.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Your Remote Operations Console application is connected to the private cloud that hosts the fictional company IEL-Drones-To-Go service, which is hosted in the IBM Industry Engineering Lab in Coppell, TX.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s review the lab’s diagram once more before moving on:
                        </p>

                        <div class="standardImage">
                            <img src="./img/dronelab2-sat-visual-animated.gif">

                        <div class="important">

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Your Remote Operations Console application is connected to the private cloud that hosts the fictional company IEL-Drones-To-Go service, which is hosted in the IBM Industry Engineering Lab in Coppell, TX. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You may remember that in Drone Lab 1, you saw a list of drones but didn’t go much further than that. In this lab, you will finally get to view what the drone sees, view telemetry data it provides, and see its relevant geospatial information. 
                        </p>

                        <div class="orange">
                            It is recommended that you revisit the Drone Lab #1 instructions site now
                            if it has been a while since you’ve completed it.
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            If you want to recall specific information regarding the Remote Operations Console, it is recommended you read the instructions for Drone Lab 1, located here:  <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dallas-gsc-gov/dronelab" target="_blank">https://pages.github.ibm.com/dallas-gsc-gov/dronelab</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is worth reviewing Drone Lab 1 <b>Step 5</b>, which you may recall, contains a breakdown of specific parts of the console application UI. This step contains clickable sections of the page that go into detail regarding the function of each widget. This lab will not cover this content again and will go directly to a new section of the console application UI - so if it’s been a while, it is recommended that you go over this step again.

                            The Build Config has several settings that can be changed. Let’s go to the Environment tab in order to view the environment variables that are assigned for the application during creation. For this lab application, we have created an environment variable "BASE_URL" to set your Lab Satellite link endpoint. The BASE_URL should contain the satellite link endpoint address you made in <b>Step 2.3.2</b>.
                        </p>

                            For the BASE_URL field, paste in the following value: <b>https://<span class="endpointAddressHere">endpoint-address-here [please go back to Step 2.3.2!]</span></b> <br/>
                            <b>Make sure the BASE_URL value starts with <u>https://</u></b><br/>

                            Now that you have updated your lab flow configuration with the satellite endpoint link you previously created, it’s a good idea to rebuild. Keep in mind that you have to rebuild in order for the application to use the new environment variable value you set for BASE_URL.

                                This bar is the top where there is a back button on the left and a close button on the right. You are able to view the drone name, its connected status, and what Operation Mode you are in. Since the drone is in flight with another pilot, you are restricted to Observation Only mode.
                            </p>

                                The bottom left quadrant has controls where you can operate the drone. Currently this isn’t operational while the drone is already in flight and you are in Observation Only mode.

                            In the Location section, turn on the Sensors in the map layers. You’ll notice that there a few sensors that are near the drone itself – click on one of them to view its information. If you recall earlier in the lab, you enabled access to these drones in the IEL Drones-To-Go private cloud service with Satellite Link and all of the sensors could be filtered to show nearby ones using the flow you added in Step 3. The connections to these services can be observed as you look at this section.

                    <p><b>Let’s review what we accomplished in this lab overall:</b> </p>

                    <p>
                        First, you explored IBM Satellite and gained a strong understanding of its key features and how it works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, you created a Satellite endpoint link that allows the Remote Operations Console to run on the IBM Public Cloud and access the drone controller service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, you created a flow using App Connect to use that drone location information to get back a list of sensors that are close to the drone’s location.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, you explored the Remote Operations Console application’s drone viewer modal, and got to see the different components associated with a drone that were enabled through the use of the above services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The takeaway of this lab is a better understanding of how various IBM services can be easily connected to a cloud application in order to augment its security, functionality, and connectivity.
                    </p>
